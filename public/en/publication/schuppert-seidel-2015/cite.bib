 abstract = {According to the Budget Approach proposed by the German Advisory
Council on Global Change (WBGU), allocating CO2 emission rights to countries on
an equal per-capita basis would provide an ethically justified response to global
climate change. In this paper, we will highlight four normative issues which beset
the WBGU’s Budget Approach: (1) the approach’s core principle of distributive
justice, the principle of equality, and its associated policy of emissions egalitarianism
are much more complex than it initially appears; (2) the Bofficial^ rationale for
determining the size of the budget should be modified in order to avoid implausible
normative assumptions about the imposition of permissible intergenerational risks; (3)
the approach heavily relies on trade-offs between justice and feasibility which should
be stated more explicitly; and (4) part of the approach’s ethical appeal depends on
policy instruments which are Bdetachable^ from the approach’s core principle of
distributive justice.},
