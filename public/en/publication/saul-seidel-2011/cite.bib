 abstract = {In the run-up to the Copenhagen negotiations, commentators, politicians and the public had great expectations of some state
taking the lead towards a new global climate deal. Is there something in such a call for leadership? In two steps, this article
provides an empirically informed answer to that question. The first part develops a theoretical account of the relation between
leadership and cooperation in international climate change mitigation policy (ICCMP). Starting from a five-dimensional leader-
ship account and a simple game-theoretical analysis of the impediments to cooperation, it is predicted that (1) increased
leadership facilitates cooperation in ICCMP and (2) different leadership modes contribute to cooperation in varying degrees. The
second part tests these hypotheses: a new leadership index measures the extent to which the EU exhibited leadership at the
negotiations of the Conference of the Parties (COP) between 1995 and 2008. This positively correlates with the level of
cooperation arrived at. The result also holds for four out of five leadership modes.},
