Alina Jacobs has been a research associate at the Department of Philosophy at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) since 2025. She is doing her Ph.D. in ethics with a focus on questions of mass surveillance and works at the intersection of ethics, political philosophy, and social epistemology.

Before that, she was a teaching assistant and tutor at the [Institute of Philosophy](https://philosophie.univie.ac.at/) at the University of Vienna, where she also served as the President of the *Vienna Forum for Analytic Philosophy*.
Her academic career took her to Heidelberg and Vienna, where she studied philosophy and German language and literature. Her work has been presented and published at venues including the International Wittgenstein Symposium.
