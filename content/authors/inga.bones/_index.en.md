Inga Bones was a research assistant at the Department of Philosophy at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) from 2018 to 2025, where she worked primarily on topics related to applied philosophy of language and philosophical methodology. Since 2020, Inga has also been working as a trainer for the [Forum für Streitkultur (Forum for Dispute Culture)](https://forum-streitkultur.de/). From 2022 to 2025, she completed further training as a philosophical practitioner at the University of Vienna.  
After studying philosophy, German language and literature, and linguistics in Düsseldorf and Stuttgart, Inga received her PhD from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in 2017 with a dissertation project on vagueness and the [Sorites paradox](https://youtu.be/2KAxsHIajps). Her book "[How To Swim in Sinking Sands: The Sorites Paradox and the Nature and Logic of Vague Language](https://brill.com/display/title/57559)" was published by Brill|mentis in 2021. A book review was published in 2021 in the [Zeitschrift für philosophische Forschung (No. 75, Issue 3)](https://www.klostermann.de/epages/63574303.sf/de_DE/?ObjectPath=/Shops/63574303/Products/2575) (Journal for Philosophical Research).  
In her teaching, Inga was responsible for the Introduction to Theoretical Philosophy. Her other courses covered topics from the philosophy of language, the philosophy of mind, and epistemology.

Since 2026, Inga has been organising freelance workshops and lecture evenings on topics related to philosophy and argumentation theory in the Karlsruhe area. Further information on current projects can be found on her private website: www.ibones.de.
