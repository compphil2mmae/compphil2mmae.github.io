In times of increasing social polarization and political radicalization, communication is more important than ever. But what actually characterizes a fair and constructive discussion? What are good arguments – and what are rhetorical pitfalls?

{{% mention "inga.bones" %}} invites you to philosophize together about these questions in the event series "Gemeinsam Philosophieren" (Philosophizing Together) organized by the initiative "Inspiration Philosophie" (Inspiration Philosophy) of the [Department of philosophy at Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/fakultaeten/philosophie/philsem/).

The two events will take place on [January 10](/event/250110_w_gemeinsamphilosophieren2025_a) and [January 24](/event/250124_w_gemeinsamphilosophieren2025_b).
For more information, see our [event overview](/event).

We are delighted to be collaborating with Heidelberg University and look forward to the philosophical exchange.
