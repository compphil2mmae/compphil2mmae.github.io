Our project **_KIDeKu_** started on 1.6.2024. The project runs until 31.12.25 and is funded by the [Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth](https://www.bmfsfj.de/) as part of the [Directive on the Promotion of Artificial Intelligence for the Common Good](https://www.bmfsfj.de/bmfsfj/richtlinie-zur-foerderung-von-kuenstlicher-intelligenz-fuer-das-gemeinwohl-198166). 


In the project, {{% mention "gregor.betz" %}} and {{% mention "sebastian.cacean" %}} are working with civil society actors to conceptualize deployment scenarios and develop technical foundations (e.g. demo apps) for the use of large language models (such as ChapGPT) to strengthen our deliberative culture.
