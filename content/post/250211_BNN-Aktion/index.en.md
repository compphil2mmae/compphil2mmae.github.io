Together with {{% mention "gregor.betz" %}}, he analyzed the results afterwards.

The debate was thematically diverse and, despite its seriousness, always respectful. Gregor Betz emphasizes: “On the way to a compromise, it is important to exchange views with other opinions.” According to Richard Lohse, this worked well: “People listened to each other.” Both the BNN and the **CompPhil²MMAE** team consider the event a success. Gregor Betz concludes: “As an event, it is an important contribution to keeping democratic culture alive”.
