This longer-term project examines how and why the character of the utilitarian project has changed from Bentham and the *Philosophic Radicals* to John Stuart Mill and Sidgwick. 

It reconstructs how the spirit of the utilitarian project has fundamentally changed in the continuous development of central ideas of the utilitarian tradition -- efforts to secularize, scientify and professionalize (moral) philosophy -- under the constellation of problems of science, religion and politics characteristic of the Victorian age: An originally radical social reform movement became a professional moral-theoretical research project. 

Against this background, the project examines, among other things, Mill's overall philosophical engagement with Whewell's intuitionism, Mill's innovation of so-called "qualitative hedonism" and Sidgwick's (also Whewell-inspired) understanding of the task of moral philosophical theorizing.
