The aim of the project is to answer the question of what exactly hate speech actually is -- or what we should understand by the term hate speech. The term *hate speech* is not a legal term and its use in public media and specialist publications is anything but uniform. Guided by the question of what purposes a meaningful concept of hate speech should fulfill, the project formulates a proposal for an amelioration of the term.
