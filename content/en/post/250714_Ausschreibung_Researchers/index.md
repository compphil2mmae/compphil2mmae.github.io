The research group *Computational Philosophy, Philosophical Methods, Moral Philosophy & Applied Ethics* (CompPhil²MMAE) at the *Karlsruhe Institute of Technology* (KIT) is seeking to recruit **two postdoctoral or doctoral researchers** (f/m/d, full-time, German TV-L E13 pay scale) for a period of three years (with the perspective for two more years) to start flexibly at around January 2026.

Successful candidates will hold an excellent Master's degree or a PhD in Philosophy or a related discipline with a strong affinity to philosophy.

CompPhil²MMAE offers a dynamic, collaborative, and interdisciplinary working environment. In our research and teaching, we focus on

- computational (LLM-based) methods in philosophy;
- normative models of reasoning and argumentation;
- the logical analysis of political and scientific debates;
- methods and tools to enhance the epistemic quality of public deliberation;
- fundamental questions in moral theory;
- the ethics of public discourse;
- normative challenges in socially relevant applied contexts such as
climate change, surveillance, and artificial intelligence;
- 19th-century British moral and social philosophy.
