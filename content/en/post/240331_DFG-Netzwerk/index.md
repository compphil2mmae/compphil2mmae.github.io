The [DFG](https://www.dfg.de) has approved a scientific network on the topic of "Methods of Practical Ethics" for a period of 3 years. 

<!--more-->

The aim of the network is to revitalize reflection on methods of practical philosophy in socially discussed, applied contexts (such as AI, data protection, climate change, etc.) and to gain orientation for a reflected self-image of the contribution of ethicists in the corresponding public discourses.

Among the 20 participating philosophers, Comp²PhilMMAE is represented several times with {{% mention "inga.bones" %}} and {{% mention "christian.seidel" %}} as well as former team member {{% mention "peter.koenigs" %}}.

The kick-off will take place in April 2024. We look forward to the exchange!
