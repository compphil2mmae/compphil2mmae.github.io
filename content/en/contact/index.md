        #### Liability for contents

        The contents of these pages have been created with the utmost care. However, no guarantee can be given for the correctness, completeness and topicality of the contents. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 para.1 TMG (German Telemedia Act) and general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we as a service provider are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general legislation remain unaffected by this. However, liability in this respect is only possible from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. As soon as we become aware of such infringements, we will remove this content immediately.

        #### Liability for links

        This site contains links to external third-party websites over whose content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot accept any liability for this third-party content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognisable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. If we become aware of any legal infringements, we will remove such links immediately.

        #### Relevant legal bases

        **Relevant legal bases under the GDPR:** Below you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Should more specific legal bases also apply in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.

        *   **Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR)** - The data subject has given their consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes.
        *   **Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR)** - processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.

        **National data protection regulations in Germany:** In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. These include, in particular, the Act on the Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. The data protection laws of the individual federal states may also apply.

        **Note on the applicability of the GDPR and Swiss DPA:** This data protection notice serves to provide information in accordance with both the Swiss DPA and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, please note that the terms of the GDPR are used due to the broader geographical application and comprehensibility. In particular, instead of the terms ‘processing’ of ‘personal data’, ‘overriding interest’ and ‘sensitive personal data’ used in the Swiss DPA, the terms ‘processing’ of ‘personal data’, ‘legitimate interest’ and ‘special categories of data’ used in the GDPR are used. However, the legal meaning of the terms will continue to be determined in accordance with the Swiss DPA within the scope of application of the Swiss DPA.

        #### Safety measures

        We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.

        The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as the access, input, disclosure, safeguarding of availability and its separation. Furthermore, we have established procedures that ensure the exercise of data subject rights, the deletion of data and responses to data threats. Furthermore, we already take the protection of personal data into account during the development and selection of hardware, software and processes in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and data protection-friendly default settings.

        #### Transmission of personal data

        As part of our processing of personal data, it may be transmitted to other bodies, companies, legally independent organisational units or persons or disclosed to them. The recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we observe the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude corresponding contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data that serve to protect your data.

        #### International data transfers

        Data processing in third countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing takes place in the context of the use of third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, bodies or companies, this only takes place in accordance with the legal requirements. If the level of data protection in the third country has been recognised by means of an adequacy decision (Art. 45 GDPR), this serves as the basis for the data transfer. Otherwise, data will only be transferred if the level of data protection is otherwise ensured, in particular through standard contractual clauses (Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c) GDPR), express consent or in the case of contractual or legally required transfer (Art. 49 para. 1 GDPR). In addition, we will inform you of the basis for third country transfers with the individual providers from the third country, whereby the adequacy decisions take precedence. Information on third country transfers and existing adequacy decisions can be found in the information provided by the EU Commission: [https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection\_en?prefLang=de.](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de)

        EU-US Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework: As part of the so-called "Data Privacy Framework" (DPF), the EU Commission has also recognised the level of data protection for certain companies from the USA as secure as part of the adequacy decision of 10.07.2023. The list of certified companies and further information on the DPF can be found on the website of the US Department of Commerce at [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/). As part of the data protection information, we will inform you which service providers we use are certified under the Data Privacy Framework.

        #### General information on data storage and deletion

        We delete personal data that we process in accordance with the statutory provisions as soon as the underlying consents are revoked or there is no further legal basis for the processing. This applies to cases in which the original purpose of processing no longer applies or the data is no longer required. Exceptions to this rule exist if legal obligations or special interests require longer storage or archiving of the data.

        In particular, data that must be stored for commercial or tax law reasons or whose storage is necessary for legal prosecution or to protect the rights of other natural or legal persons must be archived accordingly.

        Our data protection information contains additional information on the retention and deletion of data that applies specifically to certain processing operations.

        If there is more than one indication of the retention period or deletion period for a date, the longest period is always decisive.

        If a period does not expressly begin on a specific date and is at least one year, it shall automatically start at the end of the calendar year in which the event triggering the period occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships in the context of which data is stored, the event triggering the deadline is the date on which the cancellation or other termination of the legal relationship takes effect.

        We only process data that is no longer stored for the originally intended purpose, but due to legal requirements or other reasons, for the reasons that justify its storage.

        **Further information on processing operations, procedures and services:**

        *   **Retention and deletion of data:** The following general periods apply to retention and archiving under German law:
            * 10 years - retention period for books and records, annual financial statements, inventories, management reports, opening balance sheet as well as the work instructions and other organisational documents necessary for their understanding, accounting vouchers and invoices (§ 147 para. 3 in conjunction with para. 1 no. 1, 4 and 4a AO, § 14b para. 1 UStG, § 257 para. 1 no. 1 and 4, para. 4 HGB).
            * 6 years - Other business documents: commercial or business letters received, reproductions of commercial or business letters sent, other documents, insofar as they are of significance for taxation, e.g. Hourly wage slips, company accounting sheets, calculation documents, price labelling, but also payroll accounting documents, insofar as they are not already accounting documents and cash register slips (§ 147 para. 3 in conjunction with para. 1 no. 2, 3, 5 AO, § 257 para. 1 no. 2 and 3, para. 4 HGB).
            * 3 years - Data required to consider potential warranty and compensation claims or similar contractual claims and rights and to process related enquiries based on previous business experience and standard industry practices are stored for the duration of the regular statutory limitation period of three years (Sections 195, 199 BGB).

        #### Rights of the persons concerned

        Rights of data subjects under the GDPR: As a data subject, you are entitled to various rights under the GDPR, which arise in particular from Art. 15 to 21 GDPR:

          * **Right to object:** You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR, including profiling based on those provisions. If the personal data concerning you are processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.
         * **Right to withdraw consent:** You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
         * **Right of access:** You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed and access to this data as well as further information and a copy of the data in accordance with legal requirements.
         * **Right of access:** You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed and to access this data and further information and a copy of the data in accordance with the legal requirements.
         * **Right to rectification:** You have the right to request the completion of data concerning you or the rectification of inaccurate data concerning you in accordance with the legal requirements.
         * **Right to erasure and restriction of processing:** In accordance with the legal requirements, you have the right to demand that data concerning you be erased immediately or, alternatively, to demand that the processing of the data be restricted in accordance with the legal requirements.
         * **Right to data portability:** You have the right to receive the data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format in accordance with the legal requirements or to request its transmission to another controller.
         * **Complaint to supervisory authority:** Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes the provisions of the GDPR.
        
        #### Provision of online services and web hosting

        We process users' data in order to provide them with our online services. For this purpose, we process the user's IP address, which is necessary to transmit the content and functions of our online services to the user's browser or end device.

        * **Types of data processed:** Usage data (e.g. page views and length of stay, click paths, intensity and frequency of use, device types and operating systems used, interactions with content and functions); meta, communication and process data (e.g. IP addresses, time data, identification numbers, persons involved). Log data (e.g. log files relating to logins or the retrieval of data or access times).
        * **Data subjects:** Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
        * **Purposes of processing:** Provision of our online services and user-friendliness; information technology infrastructure (operation and provision of information systems and technical devices (computers, servers, etc.)). Security measures.
        * **Storage and deletion:** Deletion in accordance with the information in the section ‘General information on data storage and deletion’.
        * **Legal bases:** Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).

        **Further information on processing operations, procedures and services:**

        * Provision of online offer on rented storage space:** For the provision of our online offer, we use storage space, computing capacity and software that we rent or otherwise obtain from a corresponding server provider (also called ‘web host’); **Legal basis:** Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).
        * **Collection of access data and log files:** Access to our online offering is logged in the form of so-called ‘server log files’. The server log files may include the address and name of the web pages and files accessed, date and time of access, data volumes transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page) and, as a rule, IP addresses and the requesting provider. The server log files can be used for security purposes, e.g. to avoid overloading the servers (especially in the event of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks), and to ensure the utilisation of the servers and their stability; **legal basis:** Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR). **Deletion of data:** Log file information is stored for a maximum of 30 days and then deleted or anonymised. Data whose further storage is required for evidentiary purposes is excluded from deletion until the respective incident has been finally clarified.

        #### Use of cookies

        Cookies are small text files or other storage notes that store information on end devices and read it from them. For example, to store the log-in status in a user account, the contents of a shopping basket in an e-shop, the content accessed or the functions used in an online offering. Cookies can also be used for various purposes, for example to ensure the functionality, security and convenience of online services and to create analyses of visitor flows.

        **Notes on consent:** We use cookies in accordance with the statutory provisions. We therefore obtain prior consent from users, unless this is not required by law. In particular, consent is not required if the storage and reading of information, including cookies, is absolutely necessary in order to provide users with a telemedia service they have expressly requested (i.e. our online offering). The revocable consent is clearly communicated to you and contains the information on the respective use of cookies.

        **Information on legal bases under data protection law:** The legal basis under data protection law on which we process users' personal data using cookies depends on whether we ask for their consent. If users accept, the legal basis for the processing of their data is the consent given. Otherwise, the data processed using cookies is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in the commercial operation of our online offering and the improvement of its usability) or, if this occurs in the context of the fulfilment of our contractual obligations, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations. We will explain the purposes for which we use cookies in the course of this privacy policy or as part of our consent and processing procedures.

        **Storage period:** With regard to the storage period, a distinction is made between the following types of cookies:

        * **Temporary cookies (also: session cookies):** Temporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online service and closed their end device (e.g. browser or mobile application).
        * **Permanent cookies:** Permanent cookies remain stored even after the end device is closed. For example, the log-in status can be saved and favourite content can be displayed directly when the user visits a website again. The user data collected with the help of cookies can also be used to measure reach. If we do not provide users with explicit information on the type and storage duration of cookies (e.g. when obtaining consent), they should assume that they are permanent and that the storage duration can be up to two years.

        **General information on revocation and objection (opt-out):** Users can revoke the consents they have given at any time and also declare an objection to the processing in accordance with the legal requirements, also by means of the privacy settings of their browser.

        * **Processed data types:** Meta, communication and process data (e.g. IP addresses, time data, identification numbers, persons involved).
        * **Data subjects:** Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
        * **Legal bases:** Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).

        #### Blogs and publishing media

        We use blogs or comparable means of online communication and publication (hereinafter ‘publication medium’). Readers' data is only processed for the purposes of the publication medium to the extent necessary for its presentation and communication between authors and readers or for security reasons. In addition, we refer to the information on the processing of visitors to our publication medium in the context of this data protection notice.

        * **Processed data types:** Inventory data (e.g. full name, residential address, contact information, customer number, etc.); contact data (e.g. postal and email addresses or telephone numbers); content data (e.g. text or image messages and contributions as well as the information relating to them, such as information on authorship or time of creation); usage data (e.g. page views and length of stay, click paths, intensity and frequency of use, device types and operating systems used, interactions with content and functions). Meta, communication and process data (e.g. IP addresses, time data, identification numbers, persons involved).
        * **Data subjects:** Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
        * **Purposes of processing:** Feedback (e.g. collecting feedback via online form). Provision of our online services and user-friendliness.
        * **Storage and deletion:** Deletion in accordance with the information in the section ‘General information on data storage and deletion’.
        * **Legal basis:** Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).

        #### Contact and enquiry management

        When contacting us (e.g. by post, contact form, email, telephone or via social media) and in the context of existing user and business relationships, the data of the enquiring persons are processed insofar as this is necessary to answer the contact enquiries and any requested measures.

        * **Processed data types:** Inventory data (e.g. full name, residential address, contact information, customer number, etc.); contact data (e.g. postal and e-mail addresses or telephone numbers). Content data (e.g. textual or pictorial messages and contributions as well as the information relating to them, such as information on authorship or time of creation).
        * **Persons concerned:** Communication partners.
        * **Purposes of processing:** Communication; organisational and administrative procedures; feedback (e.g. collecting feedback via online form). Provision of our online services and user-friendliness.
        * **Storage and deletion:** Deletion in accordance with the information in the section ‘General information on data storage and deletion’.
        * **Legal basis:** Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).

        #### Presence in social networks (social media)

        We maintain online presences within social networks and process user data in this context in order to communicate with the users active there or to offer information about us.

        We would like to point out that user data may be processed outside the European Union. This may result in risks for users because, for example, it could make it more difficult to enforce user rights.

        Furthermore, user data within social networks is generally processed for market research and advertising purposes. For example, user profiles can be created based on user behaviour and the resulting interests of users. The latter may in turn be used, for example, to place adverts within and outside the networks that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. Cookies are therefore generally stored on users' computers, in which the user behaviour and interests of the users are stored. In addition, data can also be stored in the user profiles independently of the devices used by the users (especially if they are members of the respective platforms and are logged in there).

        For a detailed description of the respective forms of processing and the opt-out options, please refer to the data protection declarations and information provided by the operators of the respective networks.

        In the case of requests for information and the assertion of data subject rights, we would also like to point out that these can be asserted most effectively with the providers. Only the latter have access to the user data and can take appropriate measures and provide information directly. If you still need help, you can contact us.

        * **Processed data types:** Contact data (e.g. postal and email addresses or telephone numbers); content data (e.g. text or image messages and contributions as well as the information relating to them, such as information on authorship or time of creation). Usage data (e.g. page views and dwell time, click paths, usage intensity and frequency, device types and operating systems used, interactions with content and functions).
        * **Data subjects:** Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).
        * **Purposes of processing:** Communication; feedback (e.g. collecting feedback via online form). Public relations.
        * **Storage and deletion:** Deletion in accordance with the information in the section ‘General information on data storage and deletion’.
        * **Legal basis:** Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).

        **Further information on processing operations, procedures and services:**

        *   **LinkedIn:** Social network - We are jointly responsible with LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company for the collection (but not the further processing) of visitors' data generated for the purpose of creating the "page insights" (statistics) of our LinkedIn profiles.  
            This data includes information about the types of content users view or interact with, or the actions they take, as well as information about the devices used by users (e.g. IP addresses, operating system, browser type, language settings, cookie data) and information from the user's profile, such as job function, country, industry, hierarchy level, company size and employment status. Data protection information on the processing of user data by LinkedIn can be found in LinkedIn's privacy policy: [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy)  
            We have concluded a special agreement with LinkedIn Ireland ("Page Insights Joint Controller Addendum (the ‚Addendum‘)", [https://legal.linkedin.com/pages-joint-controller-addendum](https://legal.linkedin.com/pages-joint-controller-addendum)), which regulates in particular which security measures LinkedIn must observe and in which LinkedIn has agreed to fulfil the rights of data subjects (i.e. users can, for example, send information or deletion requests directly to LinkedIn). The rights of users (in particular to information, deletion, objection and complaint to the competent supervisory authority) are not restricted by the agreements with LinkedIn. The joint responsibility is limited to the collection of data by and transfer to Ireland Unlimited Company, a company based in the EU. The further processing of the data is the sole responsibility of Ireland Unlimited Company, which in particular concerns the transfer of the data to the parent company LinkedIn Corporation in the USA; **Service provider:** LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland; **Legal basis:** Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR); **Website:** [https://www.linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com); **Privacy Policy:** [https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy); **Basis for third country transfers:** Data Privacy Framework (DPF). **Option to object (opt-out):** [https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/guest-controls/retargeting-opt-out).
        
        #### Plug-ins, embedded functions and content

        We incorporate functional and content elements into our online offering that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as ‘third-party providers’).
