abstract: "Discussing climate change intelligently – the 20 most common excuses and how to refute them  
  
  »*We should still be allowed to treat ourselves a little.*« »*The catastrophe can't be stopped anyway.*« »*The market will sort it out.*«
  Such sweeping statements on the subject of climate change are now heard all the time. We need to do better!<br>
  With a clever interjection, five philosophers intervene in a babble of voices that needs something other than populist outrage or weary dismissal.
  Anyone who wants to take a stand must first be able to justify it. How convincing is a statement such as, »*I can't make a difference on my own anyway*«?  
  
  This book encourages all those who do not want to leave our future to the loudest voices – and shows how useful philosophy is for the big decisions of the present."
