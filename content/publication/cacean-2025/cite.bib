    abstract     = {In this thesis, I develop the method *Content Analysis of Argumentation Structures* (CAAS) as a reliability-orientated type of content analysis that can be used in social-empirical contexts to analyse the argumentation structure of texts.
                    I argue that the results of argumentation analyses are often underdetermined due to interpretive leeway and that argumentation-theoretical approaches are unable to limit this degree of interpretation. In other words, argumentation analysis is faced with an irreducible degree of interpretation. Following established paradigms in content analysis, such an irreducible degree of interpretation inevitably leads to a violation of reliability. To address this concern, I propose a statistical concept of reliability that offers a solution, drawing an analogy to how random errors are managed in measurements within the natural sciences.},
