abstract: 'The fact of reasonable pluralism in liberal democracies threatens the stability
  of such societies. John Rawls proposed a solution to this problem: The different
  comprehensive moral doctrines endorsed by the citizens overlap on a shared political
  conception of justice, e.g. his justice as fairness. Optimally, accepting the political
  conception is for each citizen individually justified by the method of wide reflective
  equilibrium. If this holds, society is in full reflective equilibrium. Rawls does
  not in detail investigate the conditions under which a full reflective equilibrium
  is possible or likely. This paper outlines a new strategy for addressing this open
  question by using the formal model of reflective equilibrium recently developed
  by Beisbart et al. First, it is argued that a bounded rationality perspective is
  appropriate which requires certain changes in the model. Second, the paper rephrases
  the open question about Rawlsian full reflective equilibrium in terms of the model.
  The question is narrowed down by focusing on the inferential connections between
  comprehensive doctrines and political conception. Rawls himself makes a demanding
  assumption about which connections are necessary for a full reflective equilibrium.
  Third, the paper presents a simulation study design that is focused on simplicity.
  The results are discussed, they fit with Rawls’s assumption. However, because of
  the strong idealisations, they provide a useful benchmark rather than a final answer.
  The paper presents suggestions for more elaborate study designs.'
