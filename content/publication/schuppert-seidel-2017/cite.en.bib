 abstract = {In this comment, we pick up three points raised by Ohndorf et al. (Clim
Chang 133:385–395, 2015) in their reply to our ethical assessment of the German
Advisory Council’s Budget Approach (WBGUBA). First, we discuss and clarify the
relationship between ethics and political feasibility, highlighting that the way Ohndorf
et al. use feasibility creates an unwarranted status quo bias. Second, we explain the
proper place historical responsibility should have within the WBGUBA, stressing the
fact that the reasons why we choose one policy proposal over another matter. Third,
we analyze the limited extent to which a normative heuristic should motivate an
ethically ambitious policy proposal like the WBGUBA.},
