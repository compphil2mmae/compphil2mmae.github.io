summary: Vortrag auf der 13. Konferenz der Society for the Study of the History of Analytical Philosophy (SSHAP)

abstract: |2- 
  Recent years have seen a budging interest in the work of Emily Elizabeth Constance Jones (1848–1922), a British philosopher on the cusp of early analytic philosophy. Most publications about Jones, however, focus on her contributions to logic and the philosophy of language. Jones’ methodological remarks, interspersed throughout her writings, have yet been underappreciated. I argue that a careful examination of these remarks paints a picture of a philosopher who, in her consideration of ordinary language and her emphasis on common sense, was well ahead of her time.
