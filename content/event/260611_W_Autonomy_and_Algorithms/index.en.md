As algorithms shape the choices we make, traditional assumptions about autonomy and deliberation come under pressure. By curating what is visible, relevant, or recommended, algorithmic outputs play a formative role in human deliberation and action. These developments raise well-known yet unresolved philosophical questions: What does it mean to act and think autonomously in contexts mediated by algorithms? How do algorithmic environments affect inquiry or deliberation? What are the implications for democratic autonomy? Furthermore, how are we to assess all this normatively?

This workshop aims to examine these issues within the frameworks of philosophy of autonomy, ethics of AI, social epistemology, and political philosophy. We welcome contributions that address conceptual foundations, engage in normative evaluation, analyze epistemic dynamics in algorithmic environments, and reflect on their institutional or societal implications.
