summary: Lecture of the Lecture series "Philosophie der Gegenwart (Philosophy of the Present)" of the Institute of Philosophy

# abstract: Moral theories are supposed to give us systematic answers to the question "What is the morally right thing to do -- and why?". There are very many conceivable theories (as answers to this question). Philosophical ethics has established a way of dealing with this challenge. We classify moral theories according to some common feature (a constitutive property) and try to show that entire *classes* of moral theories do have comparative advantages or disadvantages in virtue of their constitutive properties. The debate on consequentialism vs. non-consequentialism fits this description. In this paper, I will address a meta-theoretical question -- how should we theorize about moral theories? I will sketch a framework to approach this question and argue that the classical divide between consequentialism and non-consequentialism is no longer fruitful and ought to be replaced with a different distinction between structural impartialism and structural partialism. I will clarify that distinction and distinguish it (within the meta-theoretical framework) from other useful distinctions.
