In view of technological and socio-ecological change, there is a social need for well-founded action orientation. The involvement of ethicists seems right and necessary here. However, practical ethics, as the discipline dedicated to philosophical reflection on socially occurring discussions of ethical problems, faces the challenge of explaining which methods should be used to justify normative determinations in view of the controversial nature of normative background theories. The round table "Methods of Practical Ethics" (which is based on the [DFG-funded scientific network of the same name]({{< relref "/research/DFG_Methoden-praktischer-Ethik" >}})) is intended to stimulate exchange on the question of how the methodology of practical ethics can provide orientation.
