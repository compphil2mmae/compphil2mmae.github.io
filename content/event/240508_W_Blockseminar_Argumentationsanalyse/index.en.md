This CompPhil²MMAE project seminar is aimed at advanced students with good knowledge of argumentation analysis (as acquired in the Ars Rationalis module). In the course, participants will carry out reconstruction projects with [Argdown](http://argdown.org) on ​​texts and topics of their own choosing. In particular, these texts and topics can be related to a final thesis. Argumentation analysis helps to make such works clearer, more precise and more substantial in content -- in short: philosophically better.

In a preparatory session at the beginning of the semester, project topics are presented and discussed. Before the block seminar, participants then carry out a preliminary argument analysis and mapping. The status of the analysis is presented and improved during the block seminar.

The course is held in cooperation with [Georg Brun](https://www.georgbrun.ch/) from the [University of Bern](https://www.philosophie.unibe.ch/index_ger.html). The multi-day block seminar will be held together with the Bern seminar group from May 18th to May 21st, 2023 in Switzerland. Accommodation and travel costs will be covered. The number of participants is strictly limited. We ask that you express your interest as early as possible (by email) to {{% mention "gregor.betz" %}} or {{% mention "christian.seidel" %}} and that you register bindingly, stating the provisional project topic, in the [ILIAS course room](https://ilias.studium.kit.edu/goto.php?target=crs_2039824&client_id=produktiv) by April 1st, 2024.
