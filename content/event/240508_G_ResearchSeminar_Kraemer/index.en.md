The CompPhil²MMAE research seminar ‘"Aktuelle Texte der Philosophie" is a central discussion and reflection space for the CompPhil²MMAE team and, in the spirit of research-oriented teaching, also a course for advanced students. 

In the research seminar, CompPhil³MMAE members and external speakers present their research work in philosophy and related disciplines (usually in a *pre-read* format) for discussion.
