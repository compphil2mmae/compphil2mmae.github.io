summary: 'Talk at the conference on the Idea of Moral Progress in the Utilitarian Tradition'

abstract: |2- 
  In my paper, I will discuss a paradox resulting from John Stuart and Harriet Taylor Mill's defence of free speech in On Liberty. After I outline the paradox and reject their solution, I provide an alternative that is in line with Mill's philosophical outlook and outline some of its consequences.
