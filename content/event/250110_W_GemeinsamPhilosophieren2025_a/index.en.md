In times of increasing social polarisation and political radicalisation, understanding is more important than ever. But what actually characterises a fair and constructive discussion? What are good arguments – and what are rhetorical pitfalls?

In addition to covering the basics of argumentation theory, this workshop will address questions such as how to engage constructively in discussions with people who hold different views (especially political ones), how to deal with unfair or manipulative statements, etc.
