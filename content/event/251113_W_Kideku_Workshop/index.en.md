# Workshop: *AI & Deliberation*

**How can generative AI improve public discourse and democratic participation?**

---

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) opens up new opportunities to support and improve democratic processes and deliberation. But how can we harness this potential in concrete terms?

At the *AI & Deliberation* workshop, we want to approach this question in a practical way by presenting and discussing **concrete tools and implementation approaches**. Together, we want to learn about LLM-based applications that are useful for deliberative processes and discuss the opportunities they offer and their limitations.

The workshop promotes **networking and knowledge transfer**: by bringing in different perspectives, we want to learn from each other, exchange experiences and gain inspiration for new projects.

---

## Target Audience

The workshop is aimed at researchers and practitioners:

**Research & Science**

- Deliberation, discourse and argumentation research
- Political science
- AI community

**Practice & Civil Society**

- Organisations that develop or want to develop LLM-based deliberation tools
- Organisations that use and operate such tools in their civil society work

---

## Tools

The following tools are presented and discussed:

- [**reasonAide**](https://www.faktor-d.org/projekte/reasonaide) (DE): *reasonAide* bridges everyday conversations and online discourse. Instead of repetitive debates, *reasonAide* provides AI assistance to connect to a structured network of discussion points, understand perspectives, and participate constructively in public discourse.
- **INDI DiscussBot Demo** (DE): An AI assistant for reformulating discussion posts from the [IndI project](https://www.diid.hhu.de/forschung/projekte/indi). Formulations are analyzed in terms of politeness, reasoning, and empathy. If rudeness or a lack of empathy is detected, a suggestion for reformulation can be generated.
- [**VISAR**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3586183.3606800) (EN): An AI writing assistant for formulating and revising discussion contributions. *VISAR* enables users to explore, test and validate their argumentative goals with the help of automatic draft prototypes.
- [**PolicyCraft**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15644) (EN): An LLM-based system that structures collaborative policy design through case-grounded deliberation. The tool supports users in collaboratively proposing, critiquing, and revising policies through discussion and voting on cases.
- [**TITAN Chatbot**](https://www.titanthinking.eu/post/exploring-titan-s-approach-to-integrating-socratic-thinking-and-ai-in-chatbot-dialogue) (EN): The *TITAN Chatbot* engages users in interactive, Socratic-style dialogues designed to strengthen their ability to detect misinformation. It guides conversations through critical questioning, offers tailored explanations, and encourages reflection to deepen understanding.
