In times of increasing social polarisation and political radicalisation, understanding is more important than ever. But what actually characterises a fair and constructive discussion? What are good arguments – and what are rhetorical pitfalls?

The second part of our workshop will focus on phenomena such as framing, dog whistling and hate speech. The aim is to raise participants' awareness of these phenomena and to work together to develop counterstrategies.
