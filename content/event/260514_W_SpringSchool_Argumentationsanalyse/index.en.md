Arguments play a central role in philosophy, other sciences, political discourse, and everyday situations. However, they are often not easy to analyze, partly because they first need to be extracted from texts, because in almost all arguments justifications or conclusions are not explicitly stated, and because philosophers typically don't deal with individual arguments but develop complex argumentations and confront arguments with counter-arguments in debates.  
<br>

---
- Examine debates and controversies
- Map and logically analyze complex arguments
- Use software tools for argument analysis
- Collaborate with fellow students and lecturers from other universities
---

<br>

In the Spring School, we will develop techniques for **reconstructing complex arguments and debates**. The focus will be on [software-supported project work](http://argdown.org), where we create "argument maps" - diagrams of complex arguments. Based on these, we will discuss theoretical questions about argumentation, such as:  
*What principles guide the analysis and evaluation of arguments? How can we meaningfully address the interpretive underdetermination of argumentative texts? How can arguments relate to each other? How can logic be used for analyzing and evaluating arguments? According to what principles can pro and con arguments be weighed? What are fallacies?*

During the Spring School, participants will work on reconstructing an argument, for example from a philosophical primary text or a political debate. For this purpose, teams will be formed, which may include students from different universities.
